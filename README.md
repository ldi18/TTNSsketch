Source code for my Master’s thesis, Generative Modeling with Tree Tensor Network States.

The TTNSsketch algorithm follows ideas presented in [1]; the implementation is my own. For the Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI)-comparison, the repo JoeyT1994/ITensorNumericalAnalysis.jl is linked as a submodule.
